## Introduction

Kause is a full-stack web app created for people who want to create and organize activism events and events for a cause.The app allows them to create their event and share it directly to their facebook feed with friends and family. It allows for direct access to users to create events for a cause on their own and get thier community involved by sharing their events!

### Project Specification

This is Portfolio Project 4 of General Assembly Web Development Immersive. The goal is to create a Full-Stack Web App of our chosing. We have the freedom to chose technologies we are comfortable with, or challenge ourselves to learn new things. I chose the latter, and implemented Facebook GraphQL and OAuth2 for Facebook integration. 

### Technical Requirements

- Use Django or Express to build an application backend
- Create an application using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
- Include all major CRUD functions for at least one of those models
- Create your own front-end! Put effort into your design!
- Add authentication/authorization to restrict access to appropriate users
- Manage team contributions and collaboration using a standard Git flow on Github
- Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS, with or without a framework.
- Deploy your application online so it's publicly accessible

## Building the App
During the initial ideation of the project, I wanted to create a platform where users can create and share events for a cause. Typically, large organization create these events such as "Walk for Breast Cancer", "March of Dimes", and many more. I wanted to give users the ability to create their own events from little gatherings to large protests, walks, marathons, or even sit in's. I wanted people to have the individual power to take a stand against injustice, show up for support, or simply create a collect voice for a cause. 

Ideally, user can create the event and save it to thier profile. Upon saving it, they can look at the detail of each event and in that details page, they can then hit the share button and the event would automatically generate on thier feed or wherever they choose on thier facebook page. This allows 



### Future Implementation
In the near future, I will be adding more styling and making the content a bit cleaner. I will also be making sure that all CRUD routes are in place and functional. For my wish list, I would love to be able to add a home page where users can interact with other users on the app and post events to a shared thread so that app users can also connect with and share other app users' events. That can also be in the form of a live feed of events created and users can filter through the events to find events near them. 

I'm hoping to also add a calander feature to map all user's events on their profile and they can also import thier Facebook events if they choose. Along with the calander feature, I would like to implement the ability to add that event to any other calander they have.

I am happy with the way the app followed the prototype design specs and I will continue to build on that. With a few more features and CSS clean up, I'm confident that Kause will be one of the most useful and creative event creatation application out there!
