## Introduction


Kause is a full-stack web app created for people who want to create and organize activism events and events for a cause.The app allows them to create their event and share it directly to their facebook feed with friends and family.

### Project Specification

This is Portfolio Project 4 of General Assembly Web Development Immersive. The goal is to create a Full-Stack Web App of our chosing. We have the freedom to chose technologies we are comfortable with, or challenge ourselves to learn new things. I chose the latter, and implemented Facebook GraphQL and OAuth2 for Facebook integration. 

### Technical Requirements

- Use Django or Express to build an application backend
- Create an application using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
- Include all major CRUD functions for at least one of those models
- Create your own front-end! Put effort into your design!
- Add authentication/authorization to restrict access to appropriate users
- Manage team contributions and collaboration using a standard Git flow on Github
- Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS, with or without a framework.
- Deploy your application online so it's publicly accessible
